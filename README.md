# Linx Frontend Challenge

This project is made with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. I use fetch for API requests and Flexbox with Grid for layout.

The objective is create the provided layout and implement a list of products with pagination, here is the <a href="https://frontend-intern-challenge-api.iurykrieger.now.sh/products?page=1">API</a>

## Clone

it is not necessary any dependencies and installations to run, only clone and execute. I recomend the <a href="https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server">Live Server</a> extension for VS Code, it's worth!

Happy code!
